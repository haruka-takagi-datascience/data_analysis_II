# An Investigation into the EU Power Sector and its Clean Energy
Status

## Abstract

This report is an investigation into the European Union Power Section and its Clean Energy Status. The data used for this report is from EuroStat, and it investigated the 2019 statistics annual electricity data from 2016 to 2018 on the volumes of electricity that have been produced and supplied at the level of the European Union. (EuroStat) The data includes information on the annual total energy production of EU nations, as well as amount of annual energy production according to type, such as nuclear energy or solar energy. Our overarching research question is, how are we doing in terms of current progress with regards to renewable energy? Are we on the right track? Several statistical methods such as bootstrap confidence intervals, maximum likelihood estimation, hypothesis tests, simple linear regression, goodness of fit tests, and bayesian credible intervals were used to investigate research questions such as, what is average proportion of annual non-clean energy production in the EU in 2017, what is the estimated proportion of EU countries in 2018 that
have met their renewable energy production targets, and etc. The overarching finding was that clean renewable energy production integration is going very well and has progressed in the European Union. With specific findings such as, with 95% probability, the true proportion of EU countries that have met their target in 2018 is between 0.21 and 0.44 based on prior information. While the report does face some weaknesses and difficulty due to the lack of data points in the simple linear regression analysis, this has been suggested for future studies. Overall we were able to conclude that, results were very promising, and there is great hope that the European Union will continue to meet their target proportion of clean energy production in the coming years.

## Introduction

It is fair to assume that the most recent generation is the most aware of the issues of climate change, and
the most knowledgeable about the importance of sustainable living. The need to halt climate change and
promote sustainable living is the largest goal and problem our society faces today. In this report, we will
be investigating the power sector of the European Union and its status in its increase in renewable energy
production.

The data used for this report is from EuroStat, and it investigated the 2019 statistics annual electricity data
from 2016 to 2018 on the volumes of electricity that have been produced and supplied at the level of the
European Union. (EuroStat) The data includes information on the annual total energy production of EU
nations, as well as amount of annual energy production according to type, such as nuclear energy or solar
energy.

Increasing the amount of renewable energy production is a very effective way to reduce carbon emissions and
make way for sustainable living. This goal of increasing the use of renewable energy has been reflect multinationally
in the form of renewable energy production proportion targets. Governments across the globe have
been participating in meeting these targets set at these international forums in an effort to work together to halt climate change. An example would be the groups such as the G20, the EU and the Paris Agreement adopted at COP21. In tackling any large-scale issue, it is imperative that progress is assessed accurately
and without bias. Our report today tackles this problem and aims to accurately assess our progress in the
increase in renewable energy production using many statistical methods of analysis. The analysis in this
investigation will be important in setting new renewable energy production targets, judge how well we are
collaborating on the issue of climate change and whether our current efforts are indeed enough.
It is clear to see that such investigation holds global relevance, as the issue is inherently global. It is important
to note that international collaboration is a crucial, as well as most difficult when countries have their own
motives and goals in mind. This investigation will provide evidence on whether changes need to be made in
our fight towards sustainability or whether we are on the right track.

Before we get into the report, here is some important terminology that should be defined beforehand.
Clean renewable energy refers to energy produced by wind, solar, hydro and geothermal energy production
types. Non-clean renewable energy refers to energy produced by nuclear and conventional thermal energy
production types. A population is an entire group that we would like to draw conclusions about. (Bhandari)
A sample is a specific group that we have collected data from. (Bhandari) A confidence interval gives an
estimated range of values that is likely to include an unknown population parameter, the estimated range
being calculated from a given set of sample data. (Easton)

In this investigation we address several research questions and form several hypotheses. Our overarching
research question is, how are we doing in terms of current progress with regards to renewable energy? Are we
on the right track? Does the data align with what government officials claim to be true? Our main hypothesis
to the overarching research questions is that we have not progressed fast or far enough in renewable energy
production. And the claims made by government officials about our progress is questionable as it does not
necessarily align with our data.
